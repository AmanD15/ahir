<h1>Scoping Rules</h1>
<p>An <b>Aa</b>&nbsp;program is made of modules which in turn contain statements
and so on.  The program thus has a hierarchy of scopes 
(except for the program, each scope is delimited by &#123; and &#125;) with each
scope being contained in another (except for the program itself,
which is not contained in any scope).
</p>
<p>The rules for scoping are as follows:
</p>
<ol><li>A declared variable defined in a scope is visible
in all descendent scopes. 
</li><li>A reference to a variable <i>b</i> in a scope X is resolved by checking
whether the variable is defined in that scope, and if not found there,
by checking in the scope that contains the scope X, and so on.
</li><li>A scope can read from variables that are defined in descendant
scopes.  
</li><li>A scope can read from variables that are defined in ancestor scopes.
</li><li>A scope can only write to one of the following:
<ul><li>an implicit variable defined in the scope.
</li><li>a storage or pipe variable defined in the scope or an ancestor
of the scope.
</li><li>an output argument of a module of which the scope is a descendant.
In this case, there can be at most one statement in the entire module
which writes to this output argument.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>A variable reference in a statement may be specified 
as follows
</p>
<pre>
a            look for variable a in current scope; 
             if not found look in the parent.

:a           same as the previous case

../:a        look for variable a starting from the parent of
             the current scope.

%p:a         look for variable a starting from the child scope 
             with label p (child scope of the current scope).

../../:a     look for variable starting from the parent of
             the parent of the current scope.

%p%q:a       look for variable starting from the child scope 
             with label q of the child scope with label p of 
             the current scope

a[10]        look for a storage variable a defined in the 
             current scope.  If not found, look for it in
             the parent scope, and so on.  If eventually found, 
             access the corresponding element of the composite
             object.
</pre>
<p>Thus, a generic variable reference has the form 
</p>
<pre> 
    scope-reference : variable-reference 
</pre> 
<p>and the scoping rules forbid a scope from accessing variables
which are not defined in either an ancestor or a descendant
of the scope.
</p>
