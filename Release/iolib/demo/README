The demo consists of two process --- a client and a server ---
communicating over two channels. The client generates a sequence of
integers that it sends to the server, one at a time. The server
receives each integer and converts it to a single-precision float,
which is sent back on a separate channel. The client checks the
floating point values and reports success.

Note: Run the executables ./client and ./server in separate terminals
to keep the output readable. Invoking them on the same terminal using
'&' interleaves the output, making it difficult to read.
