copy the VHDL files from ../ into this directory
also the vhdlCStubs.* from ../ into this directory

compile testbench using compile_testbench.sh
  . compile_testbench.sh

In your simulation you will need to include
the following files.

  in library ahir
	AHIR/vhdl/control-path/*.vhdl
	AHIR/vhdl/operatorsV2/base/*.vhd
	AHIR/vhdl/packagesV2/*.vhd
	AHIR/vhdl/memory_subsystem/*.vhd
  in library ieee_proposed
	AHIR/vhdl/ieee_proposed/trimmed/*.vhd
  in library work
	AHIR/v2/CtestBench/vhdl/Utility_Package.vhdl
	AHIR/v2/CtestBench/vhdl/Vhpi_Package.vhdl
	./ahir_system.vhdl
	./ahir_system_test_bench.vhdl
	../../*.vhd

You will need to edit the file ahir_system_test_bench.vhdl
to change the name of component ahir_system to ahir_netfpga_module
in the component declaration and the component instantiation
statement.

Start ./testbench in a shell.
In another shell, compile the VHDL files in ghdl/modelsim
(correct -s option should be used in vc2vhdl in ../ToVHDL.sh)
and run with ahir_system_test_bench as the top design unit.
Run for 2500ns.
