An example to verify the functioning of the netfpga_module
wrapper.  prog.c contains a set of functions which 
describe a system which
	- reads 8-bit control and 64-bit data on
	  pipes in_ctrl and in_data
	- forwards the control and data to pipes
	  out_ctrl and out_data.

netfpga_module instantiates ahir_system which corresponds
to the system described in prog.c.

We use the AHIR flow  (ToVHDL.sh) to generate VHDL files for
the system (ahir_system.vhdl) and test-bench (ahir_system_test_bench.vhdl).
We will edit ahir_system_test_bench to instantiate ahir_netfpga_module
which is itself a reverse wrapper to netfpga_module so that the
testbench sees something which follows AHIR protocol.

Run ToVHDL.sh and then go to vhdl/ and see the README
