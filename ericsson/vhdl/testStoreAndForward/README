An illustration of mixing Aa and C code.

  prog.c and PktLib.c together code an application
  (which can be built using SoftwareCompile.sh and 
   by running the testbench executable).


  Separately, we write PktLib.aa which provides
  assembly versions of two critical functions in PktLib.c
  

  Now prog.c  is converted to VHDL using ToVHDL.opt.sh

  prog.c -> clang -> llvm2aa -> opt -> prog.o.opt.aa
  prog.o.opt.aa + PktLib.aa -> Aa2VC -> vc2vhdl -> ahir_system*.vhdl

  
  Go to vhdl/ and use testbench.c to verify.
