The following files provide an example of 
the wrap functionality which can be combined 
with ahir_glue* functions to complete an AHIR
system which listens on input data and control
pipes and sends on output data and control pipes
in a manner consistent with the NetFPGA pipeline.

ahir_system_wrapper.h
ahir_system_wrapper.c

ToVHDL.sh just checks that everything compiles ok
(down to VHDL)


NOTE: this stuff has NOT BEEN VERIFIED.
