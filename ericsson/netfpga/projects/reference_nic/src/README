The folder contains several VHDL files, and some
verilog files.  Of these, the following are necessary
for simulation/synthesis.
	ahir.vhdl
	ieee_proposed.vhdl
	ahir_system.vhdl
	netfpga_module.vhd
        user_data_path.v

The following files are the reference netfpga user_data_path.v
files, but with modifications as indicated

	user_data_path_ahir_in_mac_mux_v
		ahir netfpga_module inserted between mac
		and input arbiter.  This puts a demand of
		1 Gbps on the ahir system.  The ahir system
		just does simple forwarding.

	user_data_path_ahir_in_op_lut_v
		ahir netfpga_module inserted in place of
		output-port-lookup.  This puts a demand of
		4 Gbps on the ahir system.  The ahir system
		must do the same thing that output-port-lookup
		does.
			
The remaining files are for various possible combinations
during verification.

     The following are to be used with user_data_path_ahir_in_mac_mux_v

	ahir_system.SimpleForwarding.vhd
		this is a real ahir file generated in the
		example ahir/ericsson/vhdl/testSimpleForwarding.  The system
		offers a throughput of 64 bits every 4 cycles.

	ahir_system.StoreAndForward.vhd
		this is a real ahir file generated in the
		example ahir/ericsson/vhdl/testStoreAndForward.  The system
		offers a throughput of 64 bits every 9 cycles.

	ahir_system.simple.vhd
		this is a handwritten VHDL file which models
		a trivial AHIR system (input is forwarded immediately
                to output).
		This system offers a throughput of 64 bits every 2
                cycles.

	netfpga_module.real.vhd
		this is the real netfpga module which instantiates
		an AHIR system inside.
	
	netfpga_module.simple.vhd
		this is a simple netfpga module which just interfaces
		with the NetFPGA pipeline and forwards data. It offers
		a throughput of 64 bits every cycle.
		(do not use this any more).


     The following file is to be used with user_data_path_ahir_in_op_lut_v
	
	ahir_system.output_port_lookup.vhd
		this is an implementation of output-port-lookup obtained
		in ericsson/vhdl/OutputPortLookup.  It implements simple
		output port lookup.


Test Configurations:

	Configuration 1:  ahir system between mac and input arbiter.
	
		 Copy user_data_path_ahir_in_max_mux_v to user_data_path.v
		 Copy one of the five files which do simple forwarding to
		  ahir_system.vhdl
                 Copy netfpga_module.real.vhd to netfpga_module.vhd

		  Run nf_test.pl
		 
          Observation: all tests pass, sometimes in the long test, packets
	  are dropped.


        Configuration 2: ahir system in place of output-port-lookup
		 Copy user_data_path_ahir_in_op_lut_v to user_data_path.v
		 Copy ahir_system.output_port_lookup.vhd to ahir_system.vhdl
                 Copy netfpga_module.real.vhd to netfpga_module.vhd

		 Run nf_test.pl

	 Observation: short passes, long drops a few packets.
