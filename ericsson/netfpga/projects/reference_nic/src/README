The folder contains several VHDL files, and a single
verilog file.  Of these, the following are necessary
for simulation/synthesis.
	ahir.vhdl
	ieee_proposed.vhdl
	ahir_system.vhdl
	netfpga_module.vhd
	user_data_path.v

The remaining files are for various possible combinations
during verification.

	ahir_system.real.vhd
		this is a real ahir file generated in the
		example ahir/ericsson/vhdl/test.  The system
		offers a throughput of 64 bits every 4 cycles.

	ahir_system.simple.vhd
		this is a handwritten VHDL file which models
		a trivial AHIR system (input is forwarded immediately
                to output).
		This system offers a throughput of 64 bits every 2
                cycles.

	netfpga_module.real.vhd
		this is the real netfpga module which instantiates
		an AHIR system inside.
	
	netfpga_module.simple.vhd
		this is a simple netfpga module which just interfaces
		with the NetFPGA pipeline and forwards data. It offers
		a throughput of 64 bits every cycle.


I checked three combinations:

   full         copy ahir_system.real.vhd --> ahir_system.vhdl, 
                copy netfpga_module.real.vhd --> netfpga_module.vhd

   semi         copy ahir_system.simple.vhd --> ahir_system.vhdl, 
                copy netfpga_module.real.vhd --> netfpga_module.vhd

   trivial      copy netfpga_module.simple.vhd --> netfpga_module.vhd
		(ahir_system is not used)


The reference_nic has four eth ports each running at 1Gbps.  Thus,
the user-data-path must have a throughput of 4Gbps, that is for
about 64 bits every 2 cycles (1 cycle = 8 ns).  As a result,
the "full" system cannot keep up, and drops packets, the "semi"
and "trivial" can keep up.

If the reference_nic uses only 3 out of 4 ports, we find that the
"full" system manages to keep up.
