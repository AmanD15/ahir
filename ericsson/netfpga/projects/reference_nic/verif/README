added three tests
	test_nic_1port_long
		- same as test_nic_long, but all packets are for 
		  a single port 
			(1/4  of full load)

	test_nic_2port_long
		- same as test_nic_long, but all packets are for 
		  two ports
			(1/2  of full load)

	test_nic_3port_long
		- same as test_nic_long, but all packets are for 
		  three ports
			(3/4  of full load)


Two types of failures are seen:
	- dropped packets due to lack of room in rx queues.
	- dma error?
I have not figured out the dma error, but the dropped packets
are clearly due to insufficient throughput through the netfpga-module.
Reducing the number of active port obviously helps.
