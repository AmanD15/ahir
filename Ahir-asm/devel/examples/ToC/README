Several examples to illustrate the simulation
of an Aa description using the Aa2C converter.

In each directory, there is an Aa program together
with a file driver.c which provides the foreign functions
used by the Aa program as well as the main driver function
which exercises the description. 

Each directory also contains a script compile.sh
which you can use to run Aa2C, compile the resulting
files and link to produce the executable.
