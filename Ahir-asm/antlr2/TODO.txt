1. map all targets into their respective scopes  // done
2. resolve all references. // done
3. propagate types through the program. // done
4. confirm that there are no cycles in
   the call graph. // done
5. Let S=set of statements from which there is 
         a write to a pipe.
       T=set of statements from which there is
         a read from a pipe. 

   Then: check the following
       a. For all x in S U T, x is not a descendant
          of a branch region.
       b. There are no cycles in the petri-net which
          is obtained by treating x in S as a fork and
          y in T as a join. 
4. generate simulation model.
	- multi-threaded simulation model?
5. generate ahir.


keep it simple and dont do something here that is better
done in "ahir"
