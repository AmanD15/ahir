Test-cases for the computational procedures used in the VHDL library.

testgen: Directory for the LLVM-based testcase generator.

Run testgen to create text files containing the testcases in the
current directory.

This directory will contain text files with the following naming convention:

For binary operations:
  [gen_]<type>_<opcode>_<width>.txt

  For example, gen_apint_add_5.txt

  The prefix "gen_" indicates that the file was generated by testgen.

  The file contains one testcase per line, consisting of three numbers --- the
  two operands and the result. The numbers are represented as binary strings.

This directory may also hold special testcases that are not handled by
the generator. The names of such files should not start with "gen_".
