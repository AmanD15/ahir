  ieee_proposed libray.
  These files have been downloaded from -- http://www.vhdl.org/fphdl/

  These files are to be compiled into library ieee_proposed.
  They have been tested and are working fine with Xilinx ISE 11.3 
  and Modelsim SE 6.5b

  We will not be using this library in ahirv2.


trimmed/ 
  However, we will use the versions in trimmed/ which have
  been edited to get rid of useless functions.  The trimmed/
  files seem to work better with simulation and synthesis tools.

  Note: the files in trimmed will be compiled into library
  aHiR_ieee_proposed.
