for_fpga_impl_of_asic_rtl/

	FPGA implementation of ASIC RTL needs
	generic memories corresponding to memory
	cuts.  Files in this folder should be
	included in the ahir library during FPGA
	synthesis of ASIC rtl.

	dpram_generic.vhd
		generic dpram implementation for
		use in VHDL simulation/FPGA implementation
		of base-bank implementations.

	MemGenerics.vhd
		Generic memory cuts entity/arch defs.
		(for use only with FPGA sim)
	spram_generic.vhd
		generic spram implementation for
		use in VHDL simulation/FPGA implementation
		of base-bank implementations.
