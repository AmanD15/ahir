1. implement 64 bit versions.
2. get rid of fpsub?
3. update BaseComponents.
4. in vc2vhdl, map functions fpmul32 etc. to 
   these library functions.
5. map fp - operation to + operation by
   putting negation in the VHDL (just flip
   the top bit).  this allows us to get rid
   of fpsub as a separate unit.
