    Signaling Delays in operator components.

1.  All "standard operators"
	sample-req -> sample-ack  0
	update-req -> update-ack  1

	all other dependencies 
	have unit delay.


2.  Input port single reader

	sample-req -> sample-ack 0
	update-req -> update-ack 1
	update-req -> sample-ack 0

	sample-req -> read-req   0
	update-req -> read-req   0
        read-ack   -> sample-ack 1
        read-ack   -> update-ack 0
	


3. Output port single-writer 
	sample-req -> sample-ack 0
	update-req -> update-ack 1
	update-req -> sample-ack 0

	sample-req -> write-req  0
        update-req -> write-req  0
	write-ack  -> sample-ack 0
        write-ack  -> update-ack 1

4. 0-depth pipe.
	
	write-req -> read-ack  0
        read-req  -> write-ack 0


5. 1-depth pipe (PipelineRegister)

	read-req  -> read-ack    1
	write-req -> write-ack   0
	read-req  -> write-ack   0

6. 0-pipe -> Input port single reader -> Output port single writer -> 0-pipe -> I/P port -> O/P port -> 0-pipe..

	read-ack -> update-ack -> sample-req -> write-req -> read-ack -> update-ack -> sample-req ->


7. Input port single reader -> 1-depth pipe -> Output port single writer.

	read-ack -> update-ack -> sample-req -> write-req -> read-ack -> update-ack -> sample-req ->
