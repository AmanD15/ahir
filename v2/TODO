1.  llvm2aa produces switch statements with multiple
    place statements targeting the same place.
	-- Solution:  allow multiple place definitions,
		but handle correctly in Aa2VC.

2.  loop-pipelining control using a macro
    _Not_To_Be_Pipelined_ 

    This will instantiate a function call to a 
    special function  in the the llvm-byte-code.
    The presence of this function call in an inner
    loop candidate will suppress the pipelining of
    this inner loop.
