all destructors need to be written!

(much later-on, we may add type declarations which are not implicit)


Need to take care of the dependency of the guard
expression on prior expressions (when mapping
expressions to vc).


Conversion to VC model:
-- For pipelined loops, ALL expressions will
   need to sample their inputs and in parallel
   produce their outputs.

-- The reenable arcs for RAW dependencies will
   need to have marking = 2.
     a := (b + c)
     d := (a + e)
   The expression (a+e) uses a and has a 2-buffer,
   so (b+c) can be evaluated twice before (a+e)
   executes.

   (this can be relaxed to 1 if bypasses are added
    in the VHDL implementations)

-- The reenable arcs for WAR dependencies will be
   unchanged? No.
      a := (b + c)
       etc..
      b := (d + e)
   Since in the expression (b+c), the value of
   b will be buffered, the reenable arc from b := (d+e)
   to (b+c) can also have initial marking = 2.
