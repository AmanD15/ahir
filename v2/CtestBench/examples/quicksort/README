This example illustrates how you can use your "normal" software
to verify the hardware generated out of the AhirV2 flow.

We take the program  quicksort.c

This program describes a system consisting of a
main function which communicate with
the environment through pipes.

The multi-threaded program testbench.c will 
verify it (see sub-directory vhdl/).

Run compile.sh to generate all the files 
(as in the helloworld example).

Go to vhdl/ and follow the README
