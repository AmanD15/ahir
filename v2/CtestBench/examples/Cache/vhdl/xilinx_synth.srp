INFO:Xst - The small RAM <Mram_queue_array> will be implemented on LUTs in order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint ram_style.
Unit <QueueBase_2> synthesized (advanced).

Synthesizing (advanced) Unit <base_bank>.
INFO:Xst - The RAM description <Mram_mem_array> will not be implemented on the device block RAM because of limited available resources. If you would like this RAM to be implemented in block RAM, please select a larger device or increase the value specified by the BRAM_Utilization_Ratio constraint.
