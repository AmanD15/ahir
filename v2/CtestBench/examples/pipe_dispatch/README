an example to illustrate
	- the use of a dispatch function.
	- the use of global variable initializers
	  through the auto-generated Aa function
	  global_storage_initializer_().

prog.c contains the system, testbench.c 
the driver.  Note the function io_module
in prog.c calls the global_storage_initializer_
which is only declared in prog.c.  The body
of global_storage_initializer_() is generated
by llvm2aa.
