We have the following files present.
	system.vhdl  (generated as main_o_aa_vc.vhdl in the parent directory)
	vhdlCStubs.h
	vhdlCStubs.c

Take testbench.c from ../.
We will need to modify testbench.c a little..  The
following line needs to be added.
#include <vhdlCStubs.h>

More importantly, now testbench.c does not
need to trigger io_module, which has been marked
as free-running in the hardware.  Comment out
the lines that create the io_module thread
and also cancel it.

Now compile the testbench using compile_testbench.sh

OK.  you will now need to create a Modelsim project.
The following files need to be compiled (into
the corresponding libraries)

library    file(s)

work      ./system.vhdl
work      ../../../vhdl/Utility_Package.vhdl 
work      ../../../vhdl/Modelsim_FLI_Foreign.vhdl 

ahir      ../../../../../vhdl/control-path/*.vhdl
ahir      ../../../../../vhdl/memory_subsystem/*.vhd
ahir      ../../../../../vhdl/operatorsV2/base/*.vhd
ahir      ../../../../../vhdl/packagesV2/*.vhd

ieee_proposed ../../../../vhdl/ieee_proposed/trimmed/*.vhd*


(you will need to compile the files Utility_Package.vhdl and 
Modelsim_FLI_Foreign.vhdl into library work in order
to get the Modelsim <-> C link configured).

Now start ./testbench in one shell
and start the Modelsim simulation of work.test_system_test_bench
in another shell and you will see that everything runs great!
