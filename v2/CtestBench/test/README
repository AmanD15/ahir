A test for Ctestbench, but without using a
simulator.

Run scons to build two executables,
Server and Client.  

Server plays the role of the VHDL simulator
and takes a single argument, the number of
cycles for which it is to be run (keep this
large enough that Client finished, but not
too large, as the server keeps spinning).

Client plays the role of the C testbench, which
triggers operations in the Server using
socket messages.  The current example
illustrates burst mode control of pipes
on the Server side.
