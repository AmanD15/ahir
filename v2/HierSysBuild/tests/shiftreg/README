An example to check the uniquification feature..
required for multi-core AJIT!

A four stage shift-register (SR4) is
constructed using two copies of a two
stage shift-register (SR2)

The two stage shift-register is 
constructed using two copies of a one
stage shift-register (SR1)

The 
  build.sh 
script is used to elaborate SR4.   
Note the -u flag passed to the 
buildHierarchicalModel.py script.

The VHDL that is generated is correctly 
constructed.

However, the Aa2C generated code
needs to be specialized using the

 uniquify.sh 

script, which produces
multiple renamed copies of the 
code corresponding to each
leaf-level module.
