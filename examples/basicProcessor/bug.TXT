BUG: UNSUPPORTED INSTR

	make generates the following output

rm -f *.bc *.ll
llvmc -emit-llvm -c basicProcessor.c -o basicProcessor.raw.bc
opt -std-compile-opts -disable-inlining basicProcessor.raw.bc -o basicProcessor.bc
llvm-dis basicProcessor.bc
llvm2cdfg basicProcessor.bc
llvm2cdfg: tools/llvm2cdfg/CDFGBuilder.cpp:63: virtual void cdfg::CDFGBuilder::visitInstruction(llvm::Instruction&): Assertion `false && "unsupported instruction"' failed.
0   llvm2cdfg 0x084d0318
Stack dump:
0.	Running pass 'Generates AHIR XML' on module 'basicProcessor.bc'.
make: *** [cdfg] Aborted


	llvm2cdfg does not seem to support an instruction ("insert value?").
	

	Also: note that the tools/llvm2cdfg/ folder contains a file irgen.o
	but does not have the source from which this irgen.o was created.
