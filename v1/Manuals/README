Root directory for AHIR-tools - a set of command-line utilities that are
used to generate hardware specifications in AHIR-XML format from C programs. 

INSTALL:
--------

1. Copy this directory in a suitable location.

2. Edit the ahir-evn.bash, and update the following variables:
   a) AHIR_HOME is the absolute path of this directory.
   b) LLVM_HOME is the absolute path of the directory where LLVM is
      installed.

3. Source ahir-env.bash to update the environment variables before
   using the tools. Alternatively, this can be sourced form
   $HOME/.bashrc, so that the variables are set on each login.

TOOLS:
------

The tools are located in the bin/ directory. This directory is added
to $PATH by ahir-env.bash.

llvm-gcc : GCC-base front-end to generate the native LLVM bytecode
irgen    : utility based on LLVM "opt", that generates AHIR-XML from LLVM
           bytecode
irlink   : Linker for AHIR-XML
irsim    : SystemC simulator for a fully linked AHIR-XML specification
irsyn    : generates synthesisable VHDL descriptions from a fully linked
           AHIR-XML specification
