ahir2vhdl - Generate VHDL implementations from an AHIR description

ahir2vhdl <inputfile>

Simply invoke the utility with a single argument specifying the AHIR
description. The result is a set of VHDL entities corresponding to the
control-paths, data-paths and link layers in the AHIR modules. Each
entity is described in a separate VHDL file. In addition, ``system''
entity is generated in a separate file, that instantiates all the
other entities along with function call arbiters and a memory
subsystem.
