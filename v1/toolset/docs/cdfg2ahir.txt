cdfg2ahir - Read a CDFG from an XML file and generate the equivalent
            AHIR description in an XML file.

cdfg2ahir <inputfile>

Simply invoke the utility with the name of the input CDFG file as the
sole argument. For an input that describes a program entity ``foo'',
the output is a file called ``foo.ahir.xml'' (independent of the name
of the input file). Each CDFG in the program ``foo'' is replaced by an
AHIR module with the same name. The symbolic address space declared by
the program is not affected.
