llvm2cdfg - translate an LLVM byte-code input to an XML description of
            a CDFG

llvm2cdfg [options] <inputfile>

llvm2cdfg is compiled against the LLVM framework, and comes with a
number of optimisations and analyses provided by LLVM. See the output
of ``llvm2cdfg --help'' for more details.

For general use, simply invoke the command with the name of the
bytecode file. For a file called ``foo'', the output is produced in a
file called ``foo.cdfg.xml''. The contents of the XML file describe a
``program'' entity with the name ``foo'', which is a collection of
CDFGs, one for each function in the input input. This program entity
also describes a symbolic address space that corresponds to the memory
locations described by the input program. (For more information, refer
to the documentation for the AHIR XML Schema.)

The utility runs a number of standard simplification passes in order
to ensure that the program structure conforms to implementation
constraints. The resulting program is also printed as (human readable)
LLVM assembly code in a file called ``foo.txt''.
