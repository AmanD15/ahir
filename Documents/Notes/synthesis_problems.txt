ERROR: few errors were coming in operaotor-stub.vhdl because of absence of library declaration
solution : made the required library declaration.

solution : unconstrained ports env_call_tag and env_return_tag has to be constrained in system.vhdl.

========================== XILINX PROBLEM ====================================

In Xilinx synthesis tools whenever a component with unconstrained port is instantiated 
two times with different port width the following error comes up :-

Here: OperatorShared.vhd has a component InputMuxBase which was previously synthesized 
with its port dataL of width 16. So when we try instantiating it again with dataL of size 32 bits, 
XST throws this error.

ERROR:HDLCompiler:717 - "/home/kevin/GIT_AHIR/examples/vhdl_src/ahir/OperatorShared.vhd" Line 67: Port dataL[3] of width 16 cannot connect to 32 bit actual
Netlist OperatorShared("ApIntAdd","00000000000000000000000000000000",false,false,(0,0),"aa",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1,0)(Vanilla) remains a blackbox, due to errors in its contents

HACK :- 
->    In order to resolve it I made a new component InputMuxBase_32 whose internals
      are same as InputMuxBase but only names are different.
->    Then in OperatorShared.vhd based on the length of dataL it instantiates either 
      InputMuxBase or InputMuxBase_32.
