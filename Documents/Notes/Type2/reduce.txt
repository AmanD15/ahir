The structure of a Type-2 petri-net can be verified by progressively
reducing with the following transformation, until a single transition
remains, with no edges:

 - Input :: A connected directed graph $G=(E, V)$ with the following
           constraints:
   1. Each vertex $x \in V$ has a colour from the set $C=\{P, T\}$.
      This is represented by the function $colour : V \rightarrow C$.
   2. The graph is bipartite: $\forall(u, v) \in E$, $colour(u) \ne
      colour(v)$.
   3. There is a single marked vertex $m \in V$ such that $colour(m) =
      P$, with one incoming edge and one outgoing edge.
 - Reduction :: Transform the graph $G$ as follows:
   1. Replace all ``parallel-merge regions'' in the graph.
   2. Remove the marked vertex $m$ from G, and also remove the two
      edges incident on it. Let $init$ be the successor of m. We show
      that the resulting graph $G'$ is a TPR.
   3. Starting from $init$, traverse the graph in a depth-first
      manner. Every back-edge must be incident on a merge, else $G'$
      is not a TPR.
   4. Perform the following reduction until no further reductions are
      possible:
      1. Locate a vertex $x$ with one incoming edge and one outgoing
         edge. Let $a$ be the single predecessor of $x$ and let $b$ be
         the single successor of $x$.
      2. Delete $x$ and the two edges incident on $x$.
      3. $colour(a) = colour(b)$. If $a \ne b$, merge $a$ and $b$ as
         follows:
         1. For every successor $s$ of vertex $b$, create an edge $(a,
            s)$.
         2. For every predecessor $p$ of $b$, create an edge $(p, a)$.
            Note that these new edges preserve the bipartite nature of
            the graph. Also, $p \ne a$ and $s \ne a$.
         3. Delete $b$ and all edges incident on $b$.
 - Statement :: The graph $G$ represents a Type-2 petri-net iff the
                reduction results in a graph with no edges and a
                single vertex $v \in V$ such that $colour(v) = T$.
 - Proof :: The single transition that remains after the reduction is
            the simplest TPR in this scenario. We can prove the
            statement by proving that step 3 in the reduction does not
            alter the ``Type-2-ness'' of the graph.
   1. Show that performing step 3 in a TPR also produces a TPR.
   2. Show that the same step does not convert a non-TPR into a TPR.
