Overview

	What is the set of necessary and sufficient conditions
	that are to be satisfied when selecting a set of
	operators to insert a bypass?

Background
	
	In the initial network, 
	a. all operators in the datapath are registered (without 
	   bypass).
	b. all places in the control path are registered with bypass.


Assumptions

	In the data-path, there is a cycle containing operators A and B, 
        only if, in the control path, there is a cycle containing 
	the request-ack pairs for operators A and B.  This gets rids of 
	certain pathological cases.

	Every cycle in the control path contains at least one req-ack pair
	corresponding to a data-path operator.

Proposition
	
	Let S be the set of operators in the DP which have a bypass.

	The following condition is necessary and sufficient:
	If an operator A produces data to be used in Operator B,
	then A,B cannot be in a zero-delay cycle in the union of
	DP + CP.

Proof
	a. The condition implies that there is no combinational cycle
	   in the union of the CP + DP.
	b. It also implies that RAW and WAR hazards cannot occur.
	   For, if B is using the result of A: 
		if B is updated >0 cycles after A, there is no problem 
		if A,B are updated in the same cycle, then the next
		update of A can happen only >0 cycles later, thus no
		problem
