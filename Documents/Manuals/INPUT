The ahir tool-chain is designed to produce AHIR-XML specifications
from C source code. The C input has to follow constraints described
below:

1. The program's call-graph should be a DAG. This condition is
   currently not checked, so the result will be undefined if a cyclic
   call-graph is provided as input.

2. Following C features are currently not supported:
   a. data structures
   b. function pointers

3. The complete program must be present in a single file.

4. The complete DAG must contain a function called "start", which
   denotes the root of the call-graph. The function "main" should not
   be used, since it will trigger internal modifications by the C
   front-end, that are incompatible with the ahir tools.
