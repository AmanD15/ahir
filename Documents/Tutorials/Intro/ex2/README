A simple example describing an FIR filter. If the current
input is x(k), the output is
y(k) = 0.8*x(k) + 0.15*x(k-1) + 0.05*x(k-2)

Before running the example, go to the ahir release
area and set up the environment.

cd <ahir-release-directory>
source ahir_bashrc

Now come back to this directory and type

make SW

This will produce an executable called testbench_sw.
If you run it

./testbench_sw

It will expect you to type x values (in float format).

e.g.

1.0 0.8 0.9 0.7 0.0

For each input value that is read, it outputs the corresponding
filter output.

As soon as a 0.0 is read, the program terminates..

If the program works correctly, type

make HW

This generates two executables, testbench_hw and ahir_system_test_bench
You will need to run these in two separate shells, and observe that 
the testbench_hw behaves exactly like testbench_sw, but a lot slower!
