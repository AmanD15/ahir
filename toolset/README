The source code for the toolset is divided into two parts:

lib: C++ Data-structures that represent the CDFG and the AHIR modules,
     along with the facilities for parsing and printing XML
     representations.

tools: Source for the actual tools.

   llvm2cdfg: LLVM backend that reads LLVM bytecode and produces a
              CDFG for each function, in an XML file.

   cdfg2ahir: Translate CDFG to AHIR (both input and output are XML
              files)

    cdfg2dot: Supplementary utility that prints a Graphviz-dot file
              from a CDFG XML representation.

   link-ahir: Link the modules in an AHIR system, producing a mapping
              from variable names to numerical addresses, and a set of
              arbiters that manage function calls between modules.

analyse-ahir: A catch-all tool that can perform various analyses of an
              input AHIR description. An important transformation is
              the introduction of shared operators in the data-paths
              using a compatibility analysis. See the output of
              ``analyse-ahir --help'' for more information.

    Note that the effects of the AHIR linker are orthogonal w.r.t.
    the sharing introduced by the analysis tool.

   ahir2vhdl: Translate an AHIR description to a VHDL implementation
              based on the AHIR VHDL library.

vhdl-testgen: Supplementary utility that generates random test-vectors
              used for validating the operators in the AHIR VHDL library.
