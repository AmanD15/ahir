Building
========

Targets defined in the Makefile:

build: compiles each directory
clean: deletes object files, *.d, binaries, etc
install: first calls build, then runs the ahir-install script

IMPORTANT: Run the configure script in GenIR/ before calling make in this
directory. GenIR is actually part of the LLVM framework, and the code inside it
is not related to the rest of the code. Read GenIR/README for more information.
