# Configuring:

This assumes that LLVM is already installed and available through various
environment variables.  Use the provided configure script to generate
Makefile.common

./configure --with-llvmsrc=$LLVM_SRC_DIR --with-llvmobj=$LLVM_OBJ_DIR

Makefile.common is used by the Makefile.

=============================================================================
*** Here be dragons: ***
The configure script can be generated using AutoRegen.sh in autoconf. But the
configure.ac script uses some hardcoded locations for LLVM ... unless you
really need to do this, do not try to regenerate configure.
=============================================================================

# Compiling:

Run make.

The Makefile specifies two directories - libs and tools - that are compiled in
the same order. Once compilation is done, irgen is available in Debug/bin or
Release/bin

# Installing:

Not done here. Only possible in the Project root.
