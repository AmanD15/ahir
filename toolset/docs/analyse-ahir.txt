analyse-ahir - Run various analyses on an AHIR description.

analyse-ahir [options] <inputfile>

The following options are available:

--help
 
  Generate a brief message describing available options.

--verify-type2 <inputfile>

  Read an AHIR description from an XML file and verify every
  control-path for Type-2 constraints.

--create-labelss <inputfile>

  Read an AHIR description from an XML file and create and verify an
  LRG for each control-path. The LRG for each control-path is dumped
  in an XML file using the Boost Serialization library. It can be read
  by any utility using the LRGReader available in libAHIR.

--reuse <inputfile>

  Read an AHIR description and mark data-path operators for reuse
  using a static compatibility analysis. The result is stored in a
  file called ``foo.ahir_shared.xml'' where ``foo'' is the name of the
  AHIR program described in the input file. Data-paths in the
  resulting AHIR description, contain additional ``wrapper'' elements
  that specify groups of data-path operators that should be mapped to
  the same instance in hardware.

--verify-cps

  This is a built-in self-test that checks Type-2 verification and LRG
  generation using a set of internally defined control-paths. The
  control-paths and their LRGs used are dumped in separate XML files.
  Note:
    1. For the control-path called ``forky'', the generated LRG is
       re-read and verified in order to check the LRGReader. The
       scanned LRG is again dumped in a separate XML file for external
       verification.
    2. The control-path called ``failure'' violates Type-2
       constraints. The tool should report a failure when verifying
       this control-path.
    3. This option ignores any AHIR description provided as an
       argument.
