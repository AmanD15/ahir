vhdl-testgen - Generate test vectors to be used for validating the
               AHIR VHDL library components.

vhdl-testgen <template>

Invoke the utility with a text-file describing the components to be
tested and the desired test parameters. The result is a set of text
files, one for each combination of component and parameters,
containing one set of text vectors on each line. These text files
serve as inputs for the testbench provided by the AHIR VHDL component
library.
