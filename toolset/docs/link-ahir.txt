link-ahir - Link the modules in an AHIR program by instantiating
            function-call arbiters and assigning numerical memory
            locations to the symbolic address space.

link-ahir <inputfile>

Simply invoke the utility with a single argument specifying the name
of the XML file describing an unlinked AHIR program. The linker
updates locations in the address space to include numeric addresses,
and creates an arbiter for each module, which is interfaced with all
the modules that call this module. The result is stored in an output
file called ``foo.linked_ahir.xml'', where ``foo'' is the name of the
input AHIR program. The linking does not affect the structure of the
AHIR modules in the program in any way.
