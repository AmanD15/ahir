a pipelined (but simple!) processor.
	processor.c describes the processor.
	processorSuper.aa describes the same processor, but
		written in Aa.

	attr.vc is a "feedback" file which sets the
	number of banks on one of the memory subsystems..

testbench.c checks it out.
	- sw version: initial progam is hardwired.
	- hw version: initial program can be loaded into
	 	the processor.

Makefile
	contains builds for bothe the pipelined processor
	and pipelined processorSuper.  The same testbench
	is used to test both.


Note: another way to write the processor

run()
{
	while(1)
	{
		init();
		while(!halt)
		{
			while(!exception)
			{
				(the inner loop.. it should get auto-pipelined).
				fetch
				decode (generate all the instruction predicates)
				execute (guarded execution)

			        (exception-set-true if intr or halt or etc)
			}
		
			handle-exception.. could be an interrupt or JSR or
			unhandled instruction or window-ovflow trap or tlb miss
			etc.
		}
	}
}
