Add the following concepts to rtl
 -> subroutine call statements
	just add the notion of a procedure that can
        have signal inputs but can have only variable outputs.
	these are all zero-delay!

 -> concat, split, or/and/xor/nor/nand/xnor reduce expressions.
 -> type conversions from scalar -> scalar.
	bit-cast, cast.

 -> vhdl generation...
