a pipelined (but simple!) processor.
	processor.c describes the processor.
	processorSuper.aa describes the same processor, but
		written in Aa.

	attr.vc is a "feedback" file which sets the
	number of banks on one of the memory subsystems..

testbench.c checks it out.
	- sw version: initial progam is hardwired.
	- hw version: initial program can be loaded into
	 	the processor.

Makefile
	contains builds for bothe the pipelined processor
	and pipelined processorSuper.  The same testbench
	is used to test both.
