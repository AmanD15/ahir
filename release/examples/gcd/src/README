Run compile.sh

Run
   ./testDivider <Number of pairs> 
to test the divider.

Run
   ./testGCD <number of integers> <scale-factor>
to test the GCD.  Two files are produced, one with
the input numbers and one with the result.  To test
the VHDL, generate these two files by
   ./testGCD 16 m 
where m is the desired GCD (e.g. m = 2).
