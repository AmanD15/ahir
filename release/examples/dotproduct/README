This example illustrates the benefits of 
loop unrolling and loop pipelining.
The example consists of a dot product
of two 16 entry vectors.  The loop
involves an accumulation.


Four variants are tried
 - tight loop, no loop-pipelining.
 - unrolled loop, no loop-pipelining
 - tight loop, with loop-pipelining.
 - unrolled loop, with loop-pipelining

The observations


                      tight-loop     unrolled-loop

no loop-pipelining      11usec         4.8usec
with loop-pipelining     5.9usec       2.3usec


1. A combination of unrolling and loop-pipelining
   gives a net performance gain of more than 4X.
2. For the unrolled case, loop-pipelining itself
   adds a benefit of a little more than 2X.


Conclusion: the design goal of the loop-pipelining
optimization seems to have been achieved.
