An example of a situation where pipelining gives close to 100%
efficiency.  However, the inner-most dot-product loop needs to
be completely unrolled (16-times) in order to achieve this.

A way to break the dot-product accumulator cycle.

   product-stage ==> accumulate stage

The accumulate stage will have a loop cycle-time of
about 20 cycles (the FP add latency).  Thus, the product
stage should compute
    sum (xk.yk)
and pass it to the accumulate stage.  The product loop
cycle time should also be 20 cycles.
