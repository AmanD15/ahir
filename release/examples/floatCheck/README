you will need to have installed
	llvm-2.8
	clang-2.8
	ghdl

The directory contains
	prog.c
	prog.h
	testbench.c
	Makefile
prog.c contains a program which multiplies
and adds a pair of numbers.  A rudimentary
test.
NOTE: the multiplier currently being used
uses round-to-zero, while the adder uses
round-to-neareset.  The LSB errors in the multiplier
can be an issue.

The Makefile is self-explanatory.

run make to build
	- sw testbench (testbench_sw)
	- hw testbench (testbench_hw)
	- vhdl simulation executable (ahir_system_test_bench)

to build SW version only
	make SW

to build HW version only
	make HW

to clean up (sort of)
	make clean

to check the SW version
	./testbench_sw

to check the HW version, start
	./testbench_hw
	./ahir_system_test_bench 
in two separate shells
