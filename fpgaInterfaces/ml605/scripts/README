bitfile generation scripts specific 
to the board ml605.

To run type,
		xilperl compile.pl
in console.

Asks for the desired interface for user design 
implementation.
Type 1 for using ethernet, 2 for pcie and
3 if both of them are required.

Will generate bitfile if no error is produced.
If any error is there, will report the failed 
process.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE :
	
	xst - Has synthesis options and file lists.
		Present before compilation

	results - will be generated post compilation.
		Will have netlists after each process and
		bitfile.

	reports - will be generated post compilation.
		 will have the XST Report. Useful for 
		 analyzing pre P&R timing and device utilization

	_xmsgs - Will be generated post compilation. 
		xml extension files. Warnings and INFOs from
		synthesizer, NGDbuild, Xilinx Map, P&R tools and bitgen	



SCRIPT FUNCTIONS :
6 functions. Can be commented or uncommented as per required
extent of compilation.

	run_synthesis - XST synthesis
	run_ngdbuild - Xilinx Native database generator
	run_map - map design on the board
	run_par - placement & routing on ml605
	run_trce - post par timing report generator
	run_bitgen - bitfile generator

All functions use the outputs of their predecessors 
and will fail without those outputs.
