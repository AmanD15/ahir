	hdl - all HDLs other than the User Logic Block.
	      Mostly invariant but some parameters for
	      clock frequency and number of pcie channels
	      need to be set.
	      Visit hdl/README for more details.

	scripts - has the bitfile generation scripts. Will also 
		contain the resulting netlists, bitfile and
		timing reports.
		Visit scripts/README for more details.

	tests - has S/W testbenches for testing example designs
		provided with the package. Also has HDLs for 
		these designs which help in evaluating speed
		performance of the interfaces.
		Visit tests/README for more details.

	ucf - User Constraints File for xilinx map and P&R tools.
	      Necessary changes should be made in user clock constraints
	      according to the desired frequency.
	      Visit ucf/README for more details.

	xcf - Constraints file for Xilinx Synthesis Tool.
	      Necessary changes should be made in user clock constraints
	      according to the desired frequency.
	      Visit xcf/README for more details.
	
	user_design - put HDLs for user logic here. Top entity
		      should be same as that specified in examples.
		      Should not create any other unnecessary file
		      in this directory.
		      Mixed verilog and vhdl format is supported.
		      Hierarchial designing supported. User can put
		      multiple files in here. Scripts will pick up
		      automatically.
