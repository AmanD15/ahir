ethernet_speeds.cpp sends and sniffs raw packets.
Will output the last packet sent and last packet 
received; and transmission and reception speeds.
User can confirm that the test example design 
on ml605 board swaps the source and destination 
addresses on the packets.

To check speed performance vs size of data, number of packets 
can be changed in the cpp file by changing "numPacks" variable
