set of tests to be used to check the board.

These tests are meant to be run with the default  
example designs provided with the package.
For convenience, these example hdls are also stored
in each of the test directories.

To run the tests, compile and load the 
corresponding bitfile on ml605 first. For PCIe,
a reboot is also required.


	ethernet - has a cpp file, a timer.h and a makefile.
		   To run, use the following commands :
			
				make
				./tb

		   It will report the speed on Tx and Rx side
		   achieved during communication using ethernet

	

	pcie - has a cpp file, a timer.h and a makefile.
		To run, use the following commands :
			
				make
				./tb <fpga_id>

		It will report the speed on Tx and Rx side
		achieved during duplex communication using pcie.
		*fpga_id is 0 by default. Depends on how many 
		number of fpga cards you have on pcie buses of 
		host machine.


	dram_tester - yet to be added.
